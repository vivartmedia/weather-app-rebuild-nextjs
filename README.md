 // Brief Description of what you did: rebuilding weather up from vanilla js in React TypeScript / Next.JS

// review comment: When running the code locally on my computer it works without errrors, but you need to set up your vercel there's an error when trying to view the vercel. I like how you added the functionality to change between Celcuius and Ferenheit. Other than that added feature there's a couple things that don't match your figma. Your sidebar uses a "close" button instead of an x, your favorites list doesn't match the fimga, and your colors aren't matching the figma either. to fix the color issue you can add custom colors in tailwind. For the 5 day forecast the high and low text should be centered. Also the favorites button isn't matched to the figma either. Reading through your code it is very complex and hard for me to read through. Overall your code works locally, but you just need to fix the enviromental variable issue to get it running on vercel.







T
his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
